    "Stands for Bootstrap Aggregating. Bootstrapping is resampling data with the same cardinality from the dataset, that could help reducing the model's variance. How bootstrapping could reduce the variance? Well, by splitting our data into several small samples and feed them into homogenous classifier, we would likely to create less-overfitted models. With less overfit means, is, a lower variance. \n",

    "The main idea of boosting is to make a \"teamwork\" between models. Unlike Bagging where each model runs independently and then aggregated at the end, Boosting will add the models sequentially, one after another. A new base-learner model will be trained from the error of preivious model, hence it will boost the knowledge of the whole model gradually. \n",

This will make the model to fit more into our data, wich leading to smaller bias. Here's a visualization of how Boosting affect the model's fitness over a number of learner. Larger number of learner resulting in better fitness of the model. You will see that as the number of learner increase, the model will fit better to the data. \n",

    "The previous two ensemble methods, Bagging and Boosting uses **the same** model learner. If it's decision tree, then all the learner are decision tree. Unlike both of them, Stacking usually uses **differents** learner to train. The other difference is Stacking creates a Meta Model as it's final model to predict the output. Unlike Bagging where each models generates outputs, and then followed by aggregating the output (usually by average), Stacking will create a **meta-model** (usually a neural network) on the last process to model the output of model learner (some people call it base learner).\n"
